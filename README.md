# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classifier

This project is a simple binary image classification model that distinguishes between cats and dogs using a custom-built CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit (for UI)
- Git & GitHub

## 📁 Project Structure

## 🧪 Results

- Final validation accuracy: **55.74%**
- Streamlit UI predicts uploaded images as either a cat or a dog
- Most predictions were “cat” → indicates imbalance or data limitation

## 🔍 What I Learned

- How to build a CNN from scratch with Keras
- How to apply image augmentation and early stopping
- How to deploy a machine learning model using Streamlit
- How to troubleshoot training issues and low accuracy

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Add more training data (at least 500+ images)
- Try transfer learning (e.g. MobileNet)
- Show prediction confidence (probability)
- Visualize results (loss/accuracy graph, confusion matrix)
